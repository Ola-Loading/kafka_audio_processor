    "Spark Structured Streaming has a built-in Kafka source, so you can replace your KafkaConsumer with Sparkâ€™s readStream function.\n",
    "Instead of iterating over Kafka messages in a loop (like in Python), Spark continuously processes incoming audio chunks in a fault-tolerant streaming pipeline.\n",

    "When to Stick with Python Scripts (Kafka + Whisper + Translation API)\n",
    "âœ… Low to Medium Scale (Single Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your audio stream is relatively low-volume (e.g., one user at a time), Python scripts with Whisper + a translation API (Google Translate API, DeepL, OpenAI API) work fine.\n",
    "You could just modify your consumer script to transcribe â†’ translate â†’ send to another Kafka topic.\n",
    "âœ… Minimal Latency, Quick Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonâ€™s async processing (e.g., asyncio or threading) can keep up with real-time demands for many use cases.\n",
    "âœ… Less Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Structured Streaming adds extra setup overhead, especially if you're not processing massive amounts of data across multiple nodes.\n",
    "When Spark Structured Streaming Makes Sense\n",
    "ðŸš€ High-Scale, Distributed Processing (Multiple Streams, Many Users)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to handle thousands of concurrent audio streams and distribute transcription across multiple machines, Spark scales better than a single Python script.\n",
    "âš¡ Near-Real-Time Processing with Micro-Batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Structured Streaming can consume Kafka topics, transcribe using Whisper, translate, and publish back to Kafka in a highly fault-tolerant, scalable manner.\n",
    "Downside: Slightly more latency (milliseconds to a few seconds) due to micro-batching.\n",
    "ðŸ”„ Integration with Data Pipelines & Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're also storing transcriptions, analyzing speaker trends, or connecting to a larger data lake (e.g., AWS S3, HDFS), Sparkâ€™s ecosystem makes this seamless.\n",
    "TL;DR â€” What Should You Choose?\n",
    "If it's just a few users and speed matters â†’ Stick with Python (async Kafka consumer + Whisper + translation API).\n",
    "If you're handling massive parallel streams (many concurrent users) and need fault tolerance â†’ Spark Structured Streaming is worth it."
